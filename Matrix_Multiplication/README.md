# MATRIX MULTIPLICATION SCALING STUDY

The following is a comparison of the performance of distributed matrix multiplication. Three different implementations of matrix multiplication are compared: 
- Naive
- Cblas
- Cublas

Matrices are always initialized on CPU on purpose.

## Scaling
Scaling is performed on leonardo (Cineca) cluster on CPU only and GPU nodes. 
\
Matrix size
- 1000x1000
- 2000x2000
- 3000x3000
